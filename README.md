# project-tree: 
### classification

__________________________________________________________________

In weeks 4,5 and 6 at Metis, we had to build a classifier. After [much ado about nothing]() I settled on using the
[UCI leaf dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Leaf) and build a classifier that, given certain image feature 
will return the species of the said leaf's tree.

#### UCI leaf dataset: preprocessed data


#### UCI leaf images: processing the data myself - brute force classification -
